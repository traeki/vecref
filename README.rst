Eventually
==========

Shift data and code around so that
   * This code goes from raw input files to final outputs
   * Large data is stored in ungd
   * github is actually tracking this project
   * functions are in libraries
   * graphs and etc. are generated by scripts calling on library functions

For Now
=======

Needed inputs
-------------

* Raw tsv for annotations (lib234.raw.tsv)
* relgamma files (parent, child, all)
* gamma file

Pipeline
--------

* Downsample data
* Split & perform cross-validation
* Build trivial Keras::TensorFlow model
* Build Keras::TensorFlow model

Desired outputs
---------------

* Train/Test MSE
* Live prediction model
* Predictions (for various libraries, but esp. overall, and GFP)

Once That Works
===============

* re-allow full scale datahose
* tune hyperparameters/methods
