* Threshold on raw count
* Filter for families with strong parents

* Give Horia relgammas

* Cross-Validate
* Plot predictions

* Compute pearson/spearman correlations
* Plot per-gene scatters for comparison

* Finish re-adding weight code
   * Test-run full training
   * Examine gene graphs

* Graph train and test separately.  Are they different?
* Break out evaluation code until it runs cleanly.
* Remove evaluation code from train code.

FIGURE OUT MISMATCH
-------------------

* Compute average values for train data
* Re-train old system
* Pass average values to new system

THEN
----

-->

* Add confusion matrix to eval.

* Re-create linear model

* Why aren't we getting the outer bins?
  * Is it both bins we aren't getting?

* Write library synthesis code

* Generate prediction files
* Tune Hyper-parameters
   * check out Telos
   * Give Horia predictions
